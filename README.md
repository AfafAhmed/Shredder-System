  In processing industries, like Waste Management,accidents occurred when a worker was feeding paper into a shredder machine and did not release the paper in time to prevent the fingers from entering the shredder opening. As paper shredder continued to pull the paper into the shredder opening, it also pulled in the workerâ€™s fingers. Providing safety to workers who works on paper shredder machine using computer vision hand detection.

# Project Discription
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

1. Shredder System Project is made to predict the hand from the camera that set on shredder and give alter noice to client whenever the hand is crosses above the blue line.
2. Created as a Proof of Concept(POC) and aim to decrease accidents occurred when a worker was feeding paper into a shredder machine.
3. Deployed this POC for Internship(at Ineuro.ai) (as Freasher)

# Requirements
  Hand Images
  WebCam
  OCR
  Relay
  
# Tools and Technologies Used
  Python
  Tensorflow Object Detection 1.14 API

   Model Used for training and prediction :
      SSD Lite MobileNet V2 COCO
# Deployment
  The entire solution was deployed as an on prem solution with the required infrastructure and setup done.
